This dataset was on the more complex side, and I had to look at a few notebooks before starting my code for inspiration. 
It's an ongoing competition, but now I can update my work as I go, without creating a second notebook. It's a tougher,
more rewarding competition, but I feel as though I'm slowly making good progress.
