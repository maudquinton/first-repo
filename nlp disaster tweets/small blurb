This was the first time I tried base learners to stack my model, which I found very useful and stimulating. However, I also realised that I dont enjoy when the majority of the data is worded, I found it a lot harder to clean the data and find meaningful relationships within. I placed rather well in this competition deservingly, and also thought a turning point in my knowledge had been made.
